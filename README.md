# LSTM Model

## Project Description

This project implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predicting category changes during phone session usage over time. It is organized into different folders, each serving a specific purpose:

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- `data`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the LSTM model and the integers to strings (itos) of my 33 categories
- `preprocessing`: Includes scripts for preprocessing the data before feeding it into the model.
- `training`: Includes scripts for training the LSTM model using the preprocessed data.
- `testing`: Contains scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained LSTM model.
- `utils`: Includes utility scripts and functions used throughout the project.

## Usage

To use this LSTM model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2. Preprocess the data using the scripts in the `preprocessing` folder.
3. Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data using the scripts in the `training` folder.
4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the scripts in the `evaluation` folder.

Make sure to refer to the documentation and comments within each folder for more detailed instructions on how to use the scripts and functions provided.
